            <h1>India's Progress</h1>
            <p>India's post-independence growth has been a journey of development and transformation across various sectors. Here are key highlights of India's growth and achievements since gaining independence in 1947: <br><br>
            <strong>1. Economic Growth:</strong> India's economy has experienced significant growth since independence. The country has transitioned from an agrarian-based economy to a diversified economy with a focus on industrialization and services. Economic reforms initiated in the 1990s, such as liberalization, privatization, and globalization, have played a crucial role in driving economic growth and attracting foreign investment. <br><br>
            <strong>2. Green Revolution:</strong> The Green Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s brought about a significant increase in agricultural productivity through the introduction of high-yield varieties of crops, improved irrigation techniques, and the use of fertilizers and pesticides. This revolution helped transform India from a food-deficient nation to one that is largely self-sufficient in food production. <br><br>

            <strong>3. Information Technology and Services:</strong> India's information technology (IT) sector has experienced exponential growth, becoming a global hub for software development, IT services, and business process outsourcing. Indian IT professionals have made their mark worldwide, contributing to technological advancements and economic growth. <br><br>
            <strong>4. Space and Nuclear Technology:</strong> India has achieved significant milestones in space exploration and nuclear technology. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has successfully launched satellites, conducted missions to the Moon (Chandrayaan-1 and Chandrayaan-2), and Mars (Mangalyaan). India also established itself as a nuclear power, conducting successful nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998. <br><br>
            <strong>5. Infrastructure Development:</strong> India has invested heavily in infrastructure development, including the construction of highways, railways, airports, ports, and urban infrastructure. These developments have improved connectivity, facilitated trade and commerce, and enhanced living standards. <br><br>

            <strong>6. Social Welfare:</strong> India has implemented various social welfare programs to uplift marginalized sections of society and improve their living conditions. Initiatives like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) provide employment opportunities in rural areas, while programs like the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana promote financial inclusion. Efforts have also been made to improve access to education, healthcare, and sanitation. <br><br>
            <strong>7. Demographic Dividend:</strong> India's youthful population has been recognized as a demographic dividend, offering a potential advantage for economic growth. The country's large workforce and a growing middle class have fueled domestic consumption and attracted investment from global companies. <br><br>
